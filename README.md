## Notes:

-I know its better to add pagination to the table, but I did not added it as it's not require. Please let me know if we must have it then I'll add it in few hours.

-I used device-detector-js to get deviceType and platform version from userAgent

-for font-family, I did not manage to get `Halyard Text` from Adobe as figma so I used another font-family.

-as no design requirement for Tablet and Phone, so I just make it responsive by swipe the table, to keep it sample and readable.

-create reusable component (ex: TextBox, ReadMe, MultipleSelect...) and make every component in separate file so we can use it again.
